# Breast_cancer_model
the model which i have created is my first ever simple single layer Neural Network using PyTorch. I am very delighted to share that i have successfully optimized the code using various functions like torch.optim.SGD to update the variables. Since it was my first project i was able to make it 62% accurate.
