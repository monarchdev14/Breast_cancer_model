Project Overview
This repository contains my first machine learning project: a simple neural network for classifying breast cancer. The model was implemented from scratch using PyTorch, and serves as a hands-on introduction to neural networks, model training, and result evaluation.

Dataset
Source: [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set ]

Model Architecture
Type: Single-layer neural network

Input size: Equal to number of features in the dataset

Activation: Sigmoid for output layer (binary classification)

Loss function: [BCELoss]

Optimizer: Stochastic Gradient Descent (torch.optim.SGD)

Accuracy achieved: 62% (first run)

Results
Final accuracy: 62%

What I Learned
Basics of PyTorch (model/class structure, tensors)

Data preprocessing and feeding data into a neural network

Evaluating binary classification and interpreting results

Next Step
Improve model accuracy

Add data visualization or feature analysis

Experiment with regularization or dropout

Document additional findings or comparisons
